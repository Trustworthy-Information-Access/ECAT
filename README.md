## ECAT

This repository contains the code and dataset used in our paper: "Bridging Queries and Tables through Entities in Open-Domain Table Retrieval."

Open-domain table retrieval plays a vital role in accessing information from structured formats on the web, yet it remains less explored than text retrieval. Table cells primarily consist of phrases and words, which include numerous entities, such as times, locations, persons, and organizations. While emphasizing entities in text retrieval has been extensively studied, there is a significant lack of research on their applications in table retrieval.
In this work, we explore how to leverage entities in tables to improve retrieval performance. We investigate the important role of entities in table retrieval from a statistical perspective and propose an Entity-Centric Alignment framework for Table retrieval (ECAT). Specifically, we use entity types to highlight entities appearing in queries and tables. Then, we propose an entity-driven late interaction paradigm based on entity representations for dense and sparse retrievers, respectively. Our proposed framework is plug-and-play and flexible, making it easy to integrate into existing table retrievers.
Empirical results on table retrieval benchmarks, NQ-TABLES and OTT-QA, show that our proposed ECAT is effective in enhancing existing retrievers. Extensive analyses confirm the efficacy of \ECAT's different components.

We are standardizing our code, and it will be accessible soon.
